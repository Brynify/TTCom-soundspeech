appears
logs in
shows up
flies into the server
is here
has appeared
waves their arms frantically trying to be noticed
exists
is alive
flips open their computer lid and screams into their microphone as loud as they can
rushes onto the server and is about to send you 600 messages
decides to human
decides to be social
requires all of the attentions
presses enter on this server in their server list
is ready to human
wants to say hi
surrenders their life away and shows up
meows happily and climbs onto the server's lap
