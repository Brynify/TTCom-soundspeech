disappears
logs out
goes away
fucks off
no longer exists
flies away
Ain't here no more
flips their computer closed dramatically
dumps a bottle of soda on their router. Oops
drops out
holds down their power button
slams their hand onto their desk so hard it sends everything flying, including their computer
gets bored of this server
runs out of vocals
is done humaning
gets mad and shuts down their computer
accidentally closes the wrong window
presses F2 when they meant to press another f key
just had a blue screen
just had a kernel panic
goes to sleep
is ready to murder their ISP
